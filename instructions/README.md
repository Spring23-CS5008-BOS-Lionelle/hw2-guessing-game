### Github Commit Guide
Assignment work flow tends to be similar to the following:

* Open up your .c / .h file in a text editor
* Write or change a very small number of lines of code (sometimes just one change!)
* Save the text file
* Recompile your program `gcc -Wall main.c -o main` (or something similar)
* Run your program ./main and see if it does what you think it should be doing at this stage
  * This doesn't have to be a working program, but maybe a test you setup or print out!
* git add and git commit -m "your changes here" with the information about what you've added or changed
* Repeat!

This is the full "edit, save, compile, run, commit" cycle. It's very important that you follow this pattern for this assignment and throughout the semester! Write just a few lines of code, compile and check for warnings, and run your program. In fact, every time your program has a change in it, you should git commit the change and document it. 

Practice this pattern for this assignment and all assignments going forward! It's a crucial part of professional coding to get used to checking and committing small changes to your code base. 

Sometimes it may seem overkill, but it will make a difference as code bases get larger.
